# ‚öîÔ∏è Whiteout Survival - Formation Calculator

A powerful web-based tool to help players optimize their troop formations in Whiteout Survival. Calculate the optimal distribution of Infantry, Lancers, and Marksmen across your marches and rally for maximum combat effectiveness.

## üéØ Features

- **Smart Troop Allocation**: Automatically distributes troops based on damage priority (Marksmen > Lancers > Infantry)
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support for 4-6 marches with customizable deployment limits
- **Minimum Requirements**: Set minimum troop amounts for each unit type
- **Real-time Calculation**: Instant results with detailed breakdowns
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded troop types with clear results display

## üéÆ How It Works

### Troop Types
- **Infantry** (üü¢) - Poor damage, used for minimum requirements
- **Lancers** (üü°) - Good damage, secondary priority
- **Marksmen** (üî¥) - Best damage, highest priority

### Allocation Algorithm
1. **Minimum Allocation**: Distributes minimum required troops to each march and rally
2. **Marksmen Distribution**: Allocates remaining Marksmen equally across all units
3. **Lancer Distribution**: Distributes remaining Lancers if space allows
4. **Infantry Distribution**: Fills remaining space with Infantry

## üöÄ Getting Started
